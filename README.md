# The code of STHGNN

The code and weights have been released, enjoy it！ You can easily run the model！(Since the manuscript is still under review, only a real-world trajectory prediction test is currently provided! Complete testing and training code will be provided after the paper is accepted.) To use the pretrained models at checkpoint/ and evaluate the model prediction and real-time performance, run: test.py!

Run test.py to view the model's average displacement error (ADE), final displacement error (FDE), model parameters, GPU memory allocated, GPU memory reserved, Average inference time per run, and FPS in the ZARA2 scene of the UCY dataset.

It is worth noting that GPU memory allocation, GPU memory reserved, Average inference time per run, and FPS may vary depending on the experimental equipment.

If you can't run test.py correctly, please contact me in time! Email: chenwangxing@smail.sut.edu.cn
